## ZEN app
 Your Yoga & Meditation App



## About Us

Welcome to the calm and relaxing world of the ZEN app. We offer self-created content on the topics of meditation and yoga. In our app, you will find tutorial content on both core topics, accompanied by explanatory clips and the perfect sounds/music to enhance your experience. So, take a moment to unwind and let our app help you escape the stress of everyday life.
